Scale my Type
==============

Working demo: http://somewherepretty.net/ricardofilipe/projects/scalemytype/

## What is it?
Scale my Type is an online tool that generates a boilerplate CSS typography for good vertical rythm and alignments.

## How does it work?
Just input your desired pixel values for body text and headers, and everything will be generated for you.
All values will be converted to ´em´ values instead of pixels, so you can scale them properly.

You can also use the dummy text to preview your values. Hover the text to get a baseline.

## What's missing?
* A modular scale generator
* Auto copy/paste for the CSS output
* Maybe font choices.
